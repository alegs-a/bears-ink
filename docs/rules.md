Players each start the game with three Sunshines and three Holy Waters, but can only play one per turn.

# Game Setup
The four players are placed in the corner rooms of the board.
Dracula begins the game in the Dungeon.

Each player receives two item tokens; one Sunshine and one Holy Water.

The player team has a 5 lives collectively.
Dracula has 3.

# Gameplay
Play proceeds anti-clockwise.
After the four player turns, Dracula takes his turn.
A *round* is all four player turns followed by Dracula's, at which point a new round begins.
The players have 4 garlic tokens per round to play during their turns; these can be distributed at will.

## Player turn
On their turn a player may choose to take any of the following actions, in any order:
- Move to an adjacent room (at most once)
- Throw garlic (at most 4 times, or the number of garlics remaining that round)

Finally, a player may choose to throw sunshine or holy water.
This ends their turn.

A player may also choose to take *no* actions and receive an extra item (Sunshine or Holy Water) of their choosing.

A player's turn is over when they press the confirm turn button.

### Items
Items can be used in the player's current room, or any adjacent room.
To use an item, place it on the reader in the desired room.
The item may be left there until the end of the round, or moved to make space for a new token.

## Dracula's turn
Dracula takes his turn after all four player turns have finished.
He can move up to *three* rooms in one turn.
If - at any point during his turn - he is in the same room as a player he may bite that player, causing the player team to lose a life and the bitten player to lose their next turn.
Fortunately, Dracula doesn't like spoiled food, so he'll wait at least one turn to bite a player for a second time.
He may bite as many players as he likes in a single turn.

If Dracula was hit by holy water during a player's turn he may still move, but cannot bite until the end of the round.

# Game end
The player team wins if Dracula runs out of lives.

Dracula wins if he bites the players a total of five times.
