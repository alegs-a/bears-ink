Week: 7
Date: 06/09/24

Completed Tasks:
- Sketches for piece designs, including a reflection using Nielsen's design
  heuristics
- Made some more progress on the RFID readers. We have an idea of what the
  reading range looks like, and it seems that our idea for raised platforms will
  work well!
- Finalising the game board layout.
- Consideration of different color palletes.

Current Focus:
- Create a planning document for the
  visual design and interaction design.
- Making the RFID readers give helpful feedback to the users and error recovery
- LCD driver code
- Write quantum Dracula AI
- Implementing game logic for the board in C, ready for hardware.
- Test and refine Dracula AI prototype

Upcoming Tasks:
- Cardboard prototype of board with sizes
- CAD mockups of RFID assemblies and board
- Testing and debugging display
- Implement Dracula AI logic in C

Challenges/Roadblocks:
- Balancing work on the project with work on other classes.
- Y DO TWO PINS HAVE THE SAME NAME :( the documentation for the display kinda
  sucks as well
- struggling to get RFID to work on the STM32 (although we have a prototype in
  arduino)
