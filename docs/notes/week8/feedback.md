# Interim Submission Feedback

The next submission will have three folders - video, codebase, and report.

## Code Base

- What even is a dts file?
- Can leave notes for the easiest way to view files in editors
- We should have a high-level overview of where to find all of the code that
  *we wrote* (not listing the files that were automatically generated or are
  just environment setup stuff like dockerfiles).
- Need to include information as if there is a team we are handing it off to,
  so that they can quickly and easily get up to speed.

## Video

- Should have a document with narrative flow or what we are (loosely) planning
  to do.
- Would be good to frame the motivation for the project as using technology to
  solve a problem - there is actually a rubric item that we address the need
  for the product.
- We *need* to make sure that our video will match the brief and the rubric.
- We need to meet *everything* in *all* of the grade brackets (including
  references).
- "Ongoing, iterative development" to make the game itself fun
- Can look at academic literature [chi conference](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=what+makes+for+an+engaging+collaborative+board+game&btnG=).
  There is one about exploration of hybrid game design
