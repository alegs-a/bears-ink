# Week 10 Meeting With Chris

- Our overrall grade was poor because we had no video and effectively had no
  technical report. The things we have worked on were great.

## Code Base

- On the whole, the code base was really good

### README

- Really good on the whole
- We need to specifically flag where our handwritten code is, so that markers
  can find it without wading through automatically generated files.
- Include an ethics, security, and privacy section in the README. Explicitly
  write that we don't have any data to worry about. We can even write about how
  our particular design decisions allowed us to avoid data privacy/security
  problems. We can discuss eithics here, because we are considering data
  security/privacy
- Add these sections:
    Ethics, Data Security, and Privacy
        |
        +-> ethics (can link to another section on colour accessibility, etc)
        |
        +-> data security + privacy

## Technical Report

- Should really focus on th design
- Read the rubric very carefully, make a checklist, and then ensure we address
  everything.
