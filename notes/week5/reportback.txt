Week: 5
Date: 23/08/24

Completed Tasks:
- Completed another game play test. The key feedback was that one end of the
  board heavily favours the players.
- Sketches for interaction design
- Updated digital prototype and made an interface for AIs to control the game
- Started implementing some AI models
- Got some hardware set up and ready to receive RFID driver code

Current Focus:
- Making concrete interaction design decisions.
- Finalising the game board layout. This will have considerations for the
  interactive technology chosen.
- Fix the SoW by including concrete breakdowns of tasks, each of which will have
  a deadline. We will also include the Week 6 presentation.
- Investigating potential options for the way the AI will work
- Figuring out how our current design ideas will work in hardware, then arriving
  at concrete decisions.
- Writing RFID driver code
- Writing display driver

Upcoming Tasks:
- Milestone 1 is next week.
- Prepare the slide deck for the presentation
- Implementing game logic for the board in C, ready for hardware.
- Research and implement simple AI models in a high level

Challenges/Roadblocks:
- Some team members are having trouble getting the development environment set
  up. We might need to use x86 machines for this purpose.
- Not familiar with the OS running on the embedded hardware.
- Balancing work on the project with work on other classes

Key Insights or Decisions (optional):
- AI idea: quantam Dracula. The AI keeps track of where Dracula *could* be,
  rather than having a concrete position at all times;
- If RFID code is not being developed fast enough, we will NEED to move to
  arduino. This is not ideal because we would lose a real-time OS with threading
  and dynamic heap memory.
